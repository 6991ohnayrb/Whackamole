# project-group15

We created the game whackamole in OpenGL. Hammers, moles, bombs, and other <br />
objects in the game are hard coded. <br />
<br />
- 'r' : initially play or restart game <br />
- 'p' : toggles pause state <br />
<br />
The game can be played by using the mouse or keys. <br />
The hammer will follow the cursor when the cursor is in the canvas. <br />
Keys 'q' 'w' 'e', 'a' 's' 'd', 'z' 'x' 'c' can be used to "hit" moles that pop <br />
up. The position on the keyboard correspond to the holes that will be "hit." <br />
Note that when using the keys, the hammer will not move.
