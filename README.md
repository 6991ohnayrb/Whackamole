# Whack-A-Mole

Whackamole is created in OpenGL using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Hammers, moles, bombs, and other objects in the game are hard coded.
<br />
- 'r' : initially play or restart game <br />
- 'p' : toggles pause state <br />
<br />
The game can be played by using the mouse or keys. <br />
The hammer will follow the cursor when the cursor is in the canvas. <br />
Keys 'q' 'w' 'e', 'a' 's' 'd', 'z' 'x' 'c' can be used to "hit" moles that pop up. The position on the keyboard correspond to the holes that will be "hit." Note that when using the keys, the hammer will not move.
